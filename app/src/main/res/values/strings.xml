          The logic of redirections

          1. Array which has \"strings\" in the ending of its name - is an array for ScreenSlider Fragment
          The values from this array will be presented in slider
          First part of a name identifies to which logical state it belongs. For instance,
          introduction_strings = array for ScreenSlider Fragment, which will be presented at a phase called introduction
          button_mostly_happy_strings = array for ScreenSlider Fragment, which will be presented after button_mostly_happy
          was pressed (this state will transfer as a signature)

          2. Array with a single name (like \"introduction\") is an array which defines main menu button values.
          It should be used only for button definition

          3. Array with \"redirect_array\" name postfix is a service array which defines a redirection value for a button
          in main menu. For instance, "introduction_redirection_array" identifies a redirection value for buttons of
          "introduction" array.
          introduction[1] = x, introduction_redirection_array[1] = x-redirection-option. For instance, \"button_mostly_happy\"
          Redirection option + \"strings\" = array for ScreenSlider Fragment( see 1. )

        <item>Before designing this app
            \nwe asked ourselves:
            \nwhat do people want?
            \n
            \n
            \n
            \nThe guesses were many and none.
            \n
            \n
            \n
            \nBut to be honest, people want happiness.
        </item>
        <item>This app doesn’t give you happiness.
            \nBut it could help you gain it from inside
            \nyour inner self, situation, fresh look,
            \noccasionally, or some other way.
            \n
            \n
            \n
            \n
            \nYou might doubt it altogether.
            \nYou might be skeptical.
            \n
            \n
            \nSure.
            \n
            \n
            \nBut this game is without loss.
            \nYou only win.
        </item>
        <item>This introduction you can skip later.
            \nThe app gives some therapeutic suggestions
            \nand mind-oriented strategies, such as
            \nlateral thinking technique, which allows you
            \nto change focus of an issue and solve it.
            \nIt will also contains therapeutic and creative
            \nadvices which should be a good relaxaction
            \nand practice.
            \n
            \nIt might navigate you through some
            \nyes-no options in future.

            \n
